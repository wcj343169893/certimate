# üîíCertimate

For individuals managing personal projects or those responsible for IT operations in small businesses who need to manage multiple domain names, applying for certificates manually comes with several drawbacks:

1. üò±Troublesome: Applying for and deploying certificates isn‚Äôt difficult, but it can be quite a hassle, especially when managing multiple domains.
2. üò≠Easily forgotten: The current free certificate has a validity period of only 90 days, requiring regular renewal operations. This increases the workload and makes it easy to forget, which can result in the website becoming inaccessible.

Certimate was created to solve the above-mentioned issues and has the following features:

1. Simple operation: Automatically apply, deploy, and renew SSL certificates without any manual intervention.
2. Support for self-hosted deployment: The deployment method is simple; you only need to download the binary file and execute it. Both the binary files and Docker images are generated using GitHub Actions, ensuring a transparent process that can be audited independently.
3. Data security: Since it is a self-hosted deployment, all data is stored locally and will not be saved on the service provider‚Äôs servers, ensuring the security of the data.

## Concepts

The workflow of Certimate is as follows:

- Users fill in the certificate application information on the Certimate management page, including domain name, authorization information for the DNS provider, and authorization information for the service provider to deploy to.
- Certimate sends a request to the certificate vendor's API to apply for an SSL certificate.
- Certimate stores the certificate information, including the certificate content, private key, validity period, etc., and automatically renews the certificate when it is about to expire.
- Certimate sends a deployment request to the service provider's API to deploy the certificate to the service provider's servers.

This involves authorization information for the domain, DNS provider, and deployment service provider.

### 1. Domain

It involves the domain name for which the certificate is being requested.

### 2. Authorization Information for the DNS Provider

To apply for a certificate for a domain, you need to prove that the domain belongs to you. Therefore, when manually applying for a certificate, you typically need to add a TXT record to the DNS records in the domain provider's control panel.

Certimate will automatically add a TXT record for you; you only need to fill in the authorization information for your DNS provider in the Certimate backend.

For example, if you purchased the domain from Alibaba Cloud, the authorization information would be as follows:

```bash
accessKeyId: your-access-key-id
accessKeySecret: your-access-key-secret
```

If you purchased the domain from Tencent Cloud, the authorization information would be as follows:

```bash
secretId: your-secret-id
secretKey: your-secret-key
```

Notes: This authorization information requires relevant administration permissions for accessing the DNS services. Please refer to the documentations of each service provider for the specific permissions list.

### 3. Authorization Information for the Deployment Service Provider

After Certimate applies for the certificate, it will automatically deploy the certificate to your specified target, such as Alibaba Cloud CDN. At this point, you need to fill in the authorization information for Alibaba Cloud. Certimate will use the authorization information and domain name you provided to locate the corresponding CDN service and deploy the certificate to that service.

The authorization information for the deployment service provider is the same as that for the DNS provider, with the distinction that the DNS provider's authorization information is used to prove that the domain belongs to you, while the deployment service provider's authorization information is used to provide authorization for the certificate deployment.

Notes: This authorization information requires relevant administration permissions to access the target deployment services. Please refer to the documentations of each service provider for the specific permissions list.

## FAQ

Q: Do you provide SaaS services?

> A: No, we do not provide that. Currently, we only support self-hosted.

Q: Data Security?

> A: Since only self-hosted is supported, all data is stored on the user‚Äôs server. Additionally, the source code of Certimate is open-source, and the packaging process for binary files and Docker images is entirely done using GitHub Actions. This process is transparent and visible, allowing for independent auditing.

Q: Automatic Certificate Renewal?

> A: Certificates that have already been issued will be automatically renewed **10 days before expiration**. The system checks once a day to see if any certificates are nearing expiration, and if so, it will automatically reapply for the certificate and deploy it to the target service.
